/*
This challenge was awesome
At first I made too many divs
Also making those elemnts fit together like this was confusing, took trial and error
So I can't really explain like a pro how I did it but I did this myself no ai
I also learnt something new today border-radius to make rounder corners
I haven't learnt responsive design and I just started learning flex box
