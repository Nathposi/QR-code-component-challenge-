### What I learned

Hey I am a beginner in web development. After going to through tutorial hell I finally started understanding. I took a crash course in Scrimba by Kevin Powell.

This challenge was awesome. It was the first one I didn't look at tutorials and AI for answers (99% of the timeðŸ¤£).

I encountered some issues though;
- First the background color of my div (.class) wasn't showing correctly. I later realized it was a browser issue (phoneix browser )
- also the qr code just went to the left of the screen and the white background was huge, to the end of the screen. I tried different things but after 2 days of trying I finally asked chat gpt what happened.
- Turns out I made two mistakes;
- 
        <meta name="viewport" container="width=device-width">

It was supposed to be like this 

        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" initial-scale=1.0">

Once I did that it worked, it was amazing and I was happy ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

### Continued development
I just finished taking a crash course on scrimba by Kevin Powell. So right now I want to advance my skills in the following;
- Flex box- want to go deeper, I just know this display: flex; that's all.
- Responsive Design - don't know this at all yet.
- UI/UX design - hope this will give me an edge in making my css better 
- Grid
- JS - plan to learn this soon as well

### Useful resources
- https://m.youtube.com/@webdevelopete - this is the man who helped me get out of tutorial hell. He basically have me hope when I actually gave up. He was the one who recommended scrimba 
- https://scrimba.com/ -This helped me get out of tutorial hell. I like the way they teach and how it's divided into bits.
